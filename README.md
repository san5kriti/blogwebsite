## 🌌 About

**Esoteric Daughter** is a personal blog-verse where mythology, machine learning, metaphysical theories, and 4AM existential crises collide.  
Built entirely from scratch with **Next.js 15**, **Framer Motion**, **TypeScript**, and a whole lot of **unhinged cosmic energy**.

Here you’ll find:
- 🪐 Mythology and Philosophy deep-dives
- 🚀 Quantum and AI inspired ramblings
- 🎡 Cosmic side projects and existential code-dumps
- 💭 Raw, unfiltered, slightly chaotic storytelling
