## 🌸 Motivation Behind Esoteric Daughter

Hey, I'm **Sanskriti Shelke** — a caffeine-fueled creative who loves cats, existential philosophy, AI models, pixel art, mythology, and building dreamy side projects at 4AM.  
**Esoteric Daughter** is my tiny corner of the internet where reality is optional, imagination is law, and metaphysical chaos is celebrated. 🌌

The internet is filled with perfect templates — but none of them ever truly *felt* like me.  
I wanted a space that wasn't sterile, soulless, or corporate:  
A pixelated, metaphysical constellation where **philosophy meets code**, **chaos meets creativity**, and **dreamers feel seen**.

Thus, **Esoteric Daughter** was born — an ode to beautiful absurdity, to caffeinated 2AM ramblings, and to the cosmic chaos we all secretly hold inside.
> "Reality is negotiable. Coffee is not." ☕
